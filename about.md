On the 23rd of February 2004 a group of poi spinners set out on a mission to
define and categorise all the known poi moves.

It was a very early example of what would later become known as crowd sourcing.

This is before facebook, twitter, or even youtube existed. The web was moving
from bulletin boards to forums, 56K moderms were a luxury, and online video was
almost non existant.

A core group of 20-30 people came together to discuss what we all thought the
terminology should be, and what all the terms meant. There were people from UK,
USA, France, Italy, Czech.... and the poidia as it was known eventually got
translated into a few different languages.

One poi term which came out of this was 'Tangle' which was as attempt to make
hyperloops and airwraps less scary, and more in line with their mathematical
definition. Twists and Tangles refer to Airwraps and Hyperloops respectively.

I've had these terms lying around in various databases and it's time for a clean
out, so I'm moving tons of old stuff out into open source projects, which you
are free to contribute to, modify, fork, or play with as you see fit.

So get involved, and enjoy,

matt
