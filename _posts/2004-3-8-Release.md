A move where at any point in spinning the handle is released and the poi continues moving by its own momentum with its path unaltered, instead of having its momentum and path controlled by the hand. When desired one grabs the handle or some part of the poi, usually without adding any jerkiness; thus looking like it merely reattaches the hand and continues spinning. Different from a toss.
