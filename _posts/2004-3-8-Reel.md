A reel is a move in which each poi does a figure of eight between the front and back wall planes on the same side of your body as your arms.

There are many variations - low/hip reels done with your hands by your hips and high reels where your hands are by your shoulders, also known as windmills (split-time) or chasing the sun (in-time).
