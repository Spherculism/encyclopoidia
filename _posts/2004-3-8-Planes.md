Planes are imaginary surfaces in which you spin your poi. They can be considered 'fixed,' which means that the planes stay in the same place no matter where your body moves; or 'relative,' which means that the planes stay in the same place relative to your body (they move with you).

In many cases all parallel planes are treated as a single plane for naming purposes, but there are also names for more specific planes.

There are three commonly used planes.

The name for the three common planes when they are fixed are the X, Y, and Z planes. Imagine that you are in the corner of a room, facing a wall. The X plane is the wall you are facing, the Y plane is the wall next to you, and the Z plane is the floor. No matter how you move, the walls and floor stay in the same place.

The name for the three common planes when they are relative are the wall, side/wheel, and ceiling/floor planes. Pretend you are in that corner again. The wall plane is the wall you are facing. The side plane, or wheel plane, is the wall next to you. The ceiling plane, or floor plane, is the floor. But when you move, so do the walls and the floor. The wall plane is always in front of you, the side/wheel plane is always beside you, and the ceiling/floor plane is always horizontal (unless you are no longer vertical).

Be sure to remember that with these common names all parallel planes are treated as a single plane for naming purposes.
