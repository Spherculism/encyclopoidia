A club-swinging term for a move where you spin a series of weaves in a big circle in the wall plane - for instance starting with a forwards weave on one side going to a reverse weave on the other side by a low transition and then back to the starting position via a high transition. Seen from the front it should look like six smaller circles arranged into a big circle.

In poi spinning the term fountain is often used to describe the same but with a windmill incorporated into the high transition to give an extra two circles.

More generally the term fountain can be used to refer to various other moves which follow this pattern of smaller circles around a big circle e.g. the buzzsaw fountain.
