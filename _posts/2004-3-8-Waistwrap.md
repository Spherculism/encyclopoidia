A club-swinging term for a 2-beat split-time move where for each poi the first circle goes under the arm, the second in front of the belly and the third under the other arm followed by a carry back to the starting position, all spun in the wall plane. There are 4 variations in front and 4 BTB and these can be combined into 2 full waist wraps.

Full Waist Wrap

A move which is a combination of a front waist wrap and a BTB waist wrap - one hand is moving from left to right (or vice versa) in front of you, one behind your back. It gives the appearance of six circles in a pattern going all around your body.
