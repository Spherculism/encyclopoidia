Spinning in time is spinning the poi in sync. That is, the poi will each reach the tops and bottoms of their circles at the same time, regardless of what plane or direction they are spinning in.

For example, if you spin both poi at your sides, they will both reach the top at the same time or if you spin. If the poi are spinning horizontally, the points furthest away from you and closest to you are the top and the bottom of the circle.
